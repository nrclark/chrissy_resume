To CU's Hiring Manager,
\par \bigskip \bigskip
Hi, my name is Christine and I am looking to apply for the position of
video production specialist. I read your post on the CU website and am very
interested in joining your team. First let me start with a little history on
my part. I graduated from film school in 2008 with a bachelor’s degree in
film and video production. I have been working as an editor for the past
five years where I have worked on tv shows and web content.
\par \bigskip \smallskip
I moved to Colorado to be with my fiancé, as he has moved here for work.
Now, I too, am looking for a job. I understand you want to film classes
for online use, and I think my background really matches your needs.
\par \bigskip \smallskip
I do feel I have the experience and knowledge to join your team, and make
online content for students to advance their education. Not only that, I
like working in teams and with other people. I am a creative person who
likes to collaborate while making videos.
\par \bigskip \bigskip
Best regards,
\par \smallskip
Christine Waynick
